    This claim is standard, and the proof is included for the sake of
        completeness.  The idea is to apply a shrinking process of $C$, as
        illustrated in \figref{shrink:h}.  Consider the mapping
        $f_{\beta, \pd} : \px \mapsto \beta (\px - \pd) + \pd $. It is a
        scaling of the plane around $\pd$ by a factor of $\beta$. Let
        $\beta'$ be the minimum value of $\beta$ such that
        $C_1 = f_{\beta,\pa}(C)$ contains $\pb$ (i.e. we perform central
        dilation of $C$ around $\pa$ till $\pb$ becomes a boundary
        point). Next, shrink $C'$ around $\pb$, till $\pa$ becomes a
        boundary point -- formally, let $\beta''$ be the minimum value of
        $\beta$ such that $C' = f_{\beta,\pb}(C_1)$ contains $\pa$. Since
        $C' \subseteq C_1 \subseteq C$, and $\pa, \pb \in \partial C'$,
        the claim follows.
