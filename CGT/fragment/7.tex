    Let $\epsA = \eps/\constD$, for $\constD$ sufficiently large
    constant.  We construct $\Triangles$, a family of triangles
    induced by a vertex of $\Body$, and an non-adjacent edge of
    $\Body$. This family has $\Of(k^2)$ triangles. Each such triangle
    is $\Omega(1/k)$-fat, and for each such triangle we construct the
    $(1+\epsA)$-spanner of \thmref{l:s:triangle} for \PS. Next, we
    cover $\CC$ by a set $\Traps$ of $k' = \Of(k^4/\epsA^3)$
    $\epsA$-narrow trapezoids using \lemref{narrow:traps:decomp}.

    We compute an $\epsA$-angular $(1/\epsA)$-\SSPD $\WS$
    decomposition of $\PS$ using \corref{S:S:P:D:angular} -- the total
    weight of the decomposition is
    $w = \Of\pth{ n \epsA^{-3} \log n }$. For each pair
    $\{\PX, \PY\} \in \WS$, and each trapezoid $\Trap \in \Traps$, we
    compute the $\Trap$-Delaunay triangulation of $\PX \cup \PY$.

    Let $\G$ denote the union of all these graphs. We claim that it is
    the desired spanner.  The construction time is
    \begin{equation*}
        \Of(( k^3 /\epsA) n \log n + k' w \log n)
        =%
        \Of\pth{
           \frac{k^3 }{\epsA} n \log n + \frac{k^4}{\epsA^3} \cdot
           \frac{n}{\epsA^{3}} \log n \cdot \log n
        }%
        =%
        \Of\pth{ \frac{k^4}{\epsA^6}n \log^2 n},%
    \end{equation*}
    and the resulting graph has
    $\Of\pth{\bigl. ( {k^4}/{\epsA^6})n \log n}$ edges.

    As for correctness, consider a homothet $\Body'$ of $\Body$ that
    contains two points $\pa, \pb \in \PS$. By \lemref{shrink:shrank},
    there is a homothet $\Body'' \subseteq \Body'$ of $\Body$ such
    that $\pa, \pb \in \partial \Body''$. There are two possibilities:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item

    \smallskip%
    \noindent
    \textbf{(A)} The point $\pa$ is on a vertex of $\Body''$ and $\pb$
    is on an edge. In this case, the vertex and the edge induce a fat
    triangle, that is a homothet of a triangle
    $\triangle \in \Triangles$. Since the graph $\G$ contains a
    $\triangle$-local $(1+\eps)$-spanner for $\PS$, it follows readily
    that $\G$ is a $(1+\eps)$-spanner for these points, and the path
    is strictly inside $\Body''$.

    % \item
    \smallskip%
    \noindent%
    \textbf{(B)} %
    The points $\pa$ and $\pb$ are on two non-adjacent edges of
    $\Body''$. Then, there is an $\epsA$-narrow trapezoid $\Trap'$
    that has $\pa$ and $\pb$ on its two legs, and a homothet of
    $\Trap'$, denoted by $\Trap$, is in $\Traps$. There is a pair
    $\{\PX, \PY\} \in \WS$ that is $(1/\epsA)$-semi separated (and
    $\epsA$-angularly separated), such that $\pa \in \PX$ and
    $\pb \in \PY$.  By \lemref{good:jump:traps}, there are two points
    $\pa' \in \PX$ and $\pb' \in \PY$, such that $\pa'\pb'$ is an edge
    of the $\Trap$-Delaunay triangulation of $\PX \cup \PY$, and by
    construction this edge is in $\G$. We now use induction on the
    shortest paths from $\pa$ to $\pa'$ and from $\pb$ to $\pb'$ in
    $\G$.  By induction, and \lemref{good:jump:traps}, we have that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dGY{\pa}{\pb} %
        \leq%
        \dGY{\pa}{\pa'} + \dY{\pa'}{\pb'} + \dGY{\pb'}{\pb}
        \leq
        (1+\eps)\dY{\pa}{\pa'} + \dY{\pa'}{\pb'} + (1+\eps)
        \dY{\pb'}{\pb}
        \leq%
        (1+\eps) \dY{\pa}{\pb},
    \end{equation*}
    which implies that the there is $(1+\eps)$-path from $\pa$ to
    $\pb$ inside $\Body'$.
    % \end{itemize}
