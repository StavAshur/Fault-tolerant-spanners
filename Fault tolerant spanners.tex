\title{Fault tolerant spanners}

\begin{document}
	
	
	\maketitle
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
	Let $\FF$ be a family of regions in the plane, which we call the fault regions. For a fault region $F\in \FF$ and a geometric graph $G$ on a point set $P$ , we define $G\ominus F$ to be the part of $G$ that remains after the points from $P$ inside $F$ and all edges that intersect $F$ have been removed from the graph. For simplicity, we assume that a region fault F does not contain its boundary, i.e., only vertices and edges intersecting the interior of $F$ will be affected.
	
	Let $\LL$ be a family of regions in the plane, which we call the local regions. For a fault region $L\in \LL$ and a geometric graph $G$ on a point set $P$ , we define $G\mid_F$ to be the part of $G$ contained in the interior of $F$, meaning only the vertices and edges that are fully containd in the interior of $F$.
	
	\paragraph{The problem:} Given a set $P$ of points in $\R^2$, and a family $\FF$ of regions, compute a graph $G$ that is a $t$-spanner of $P$ under any fault $F\in\FF$.
	
	\section{Complement of disk faults / disk local spanners}
	
	Let $\LL$ be the set of disks, we can use the algorithm of Abam et al. \cite{bibid}, and replace the set of edges between every pair $(A_i,B_i)$ in the SSPD with the edges of the Delaunay triangulation $\DT(P)$ with one end in $A_i$ and the other in $B_i$. We only need to prove that for any disk $d\in \LL$, and for any set $P'$ of points we have that $\DT(P')\mid_d$ is connected, as that will imply that for every pair $(A_i,B_i)$ of the SSPD, if $A_i\cap d$ and $B_i\cap d$ are not empty, there exists an edge between them in the constructed graph $G$.
	
	\begin{claim}
		For a set of points $P\subseteq \R^2$ and for any disk $d$, $\DT(P)\mid_d$ is connected.
	\end{claim}

	\begin{proof}
		We prove a different claim that immediately implies the desired one. Let $d$ be a disk with two points $p,q\in P$ on its boundary. Then there is a path between $p$ and $q$ in $\DT(P)\mid_d$.
		
		We prove by induction over the number points in the interior of $d$.
		
		$|d\cap (P\setminus \partial d)| = 0$: Then by construction of the Delaunay triangulation the edge $\{p,q\}$ is in $\DT(P)$ and is contained in the interior of $D$.\\
		
		$|d\cap (P\setminus \partial d)| > 0$: Let $x\in P$ be a point in the interior of $d$. We move the center of $d$ in the direction of $p$, shrinking $d$ in the process, until we get a disk $d'\subseteq d$ such that $x$ is on the boundary of $d'$. By induction there is a path between $p$ and $x$ in $\DT\mid_{d'}$, and since $\DT\mid_{d'}\subseteq \DT\mid_{d}$ we have that the same path exists in $\DT\mid_{d}$. The same proof gives us a path between $x$ and $q$ and thus we are done.
		
	\end{proof}

	\section{Complement of square faults / square local spanners}
	
	For the same reasons, if we can prove that for a square $s$ we have that $\DT_\infty\mid_s$, where $\DT_\infty$ is the $L_{\infty}$ norm Delaunay triangulation, is connected, we would be able to use the same algorithm almost verbatim. Fortunately, the same proof works just as well when replacing disks with squares.
	
	
	\section{Complement of convex symmetric polygonal faults / convex symmetric polygonal local spanners}
	
	Since the Delanay triangulation is well defined for the \emph{polygonal convex distance} (L.P. Chew and R.L. Drysdale. Voronoi diagrams based on convex distance functions.InProc. 1st Sympos. Comput. Geom., pages 234â€“244, ACM Press, 1985), we can use the exact same proof (again replacing only the distance function and the disk) to get an algorithm for this entire family of problems.
	
	\section{$\eps$-shadow}
	
	In this section we consider a weaker form of fault tolerance. Given a family $\LL$ of shapes, we say that $G$ is a $(\LL,\eps)$-local spanner if for any $L\in\LL$ we have that $G\mid_{L_{\alpha}}$, where $L_{\alpha}$ is $L$ rescaled by $\alpha$, is a $t$-spanner of $P$. For the sake of clarity we will use $\alpha = 1-\eps$.
	
	\subsection{$\beta$-fat rectangles}
	Let $\LL$ be the set of $\beta$-fat axis parallel rectangles. We repeatedly preform the algorithm for convex symmetric polygonal local spanners, where in the $i$-th iteration we use a rectangle with aspect ratio $\left(1+\eps\right)^i$, where $i\in\{0,...,\log_{1+\eps}(\beta)\}$. 
	
	Let $r$ be a $\beta$-fat rectangle, and let $(A_i,B_i)$ be a pair in an SSPD such that $A_i\cap r\neq \emptyset$, and $B_i\cap r\neq \emptyset$. We assume w.l.o.g that the height of $r$ is 1, and its width is $\beta'\in [1,\beta]$.

	Let $i\in \{0,...,\log_{1+\eps}(\beta)\}$ be an index for which $\beta' \leq (1+\eps)^i \leq \frac{\beta}{1-\eps}$ if such an index exists, then let $r'$ be the rectangle with width $\beta'$ and aspect ratio $(1+\eps)^i$, whose horizontal bisector coincides with that of $r$. Since $(1+\eps)^i \leq \frac{\beta}{1-\eps}$, we have that $r\setminus r'$ is contained within the shadow of $r$, and therefore if $r'$ contains points of both $A_i$ and $B_i$, then due to the correctness of the convex symmetric polygonal fault spanner, we will have an edge between a point in $A_I\cap r'$ and $B_i\cap r'$.
	
	We are left with proving that there exists an index $i\in \{0,...,\log_{1+\eps}(\beta)\}$ for which $\beta' \leq (1+\eps)^i \leq \frac{\beta}{1-\eps}$.
	
	$$\beta' \leq (1+\eps)^i \leq \frac{\beta}{1-\eps}$$
	
	$$\log_{1+\eps}(\beta') \leq i \leq \log_{1+\eps}\left(\frac{\beta}{1-\eps}\right)$$
	
	$$\log_{1+\eps}(\beta') \leq i \leq \log_{1+\eps}(\beta) - \log_{1+\eps}(1-\eps)$$
	
	If $\log_{1+\eps}(1-\eps)<-1$, then there must be an integer $i$ with the required properties. We now notice that $(1+\eps)^{-1}=\frac{1}{1+\eps}>(1-\eps)$ [since $1>(1-\eps)(1+\eps)=(1-\eps^2)$], and so $i$ exists.
	
	The size of the spanner is $\log_{1+\eps}(\beta)$ times the number of edges in a convex symmetric polygonal local spanner, and since $\log_{1+\eps}(\beta)=O\frac{\log(\beta)}{\eps}$, we have a spanner of size ???
	
	
	\subsection{Arbitrary rectangles}
	
	We first describe a subroutine for connecting two sets of points, $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is contained in the negative quadrant of the plane (i.e., have a negative value $x$-coordinate and a negative value $y$-coordinate), and $B$ is contained in the positive quadrant of the plane. Denote $A=\{a_i~|~ 1\leq i \leq |A|\}$, and Let
	
	$$A' = \{a_i\in A~|~ \text{the rectangle defined by the corners }(x_i,y_i)\text{ and } (0,0)\text{ contains no points of }A\}$$
	
	For every point $a_i\in A'$ we define $a_i^+=(|x_i|,|y_i|)$, and denote the rectangle defined by the corners $a_i^+$ and $(0,0)$ by $r_i$. The algorithm will connect $a_i$ to $O\left(\frac{1}{\eps^2}\right)$ points in the positive quadrant, such that each
